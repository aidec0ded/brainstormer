# Brainstorming App

A Python-based application that facilitates **multi-persona** brainstorming sessions using **OpenAI** and **ChromaDB**. This app allows you to:

- Dynamically select or auto-select personas for brainstorming.
- Store and retrieve conversation history in **ChromaDB**.
- Generate a final **consulting-style** proposal based on the conversation.

## Features

1. **Persona Library**  
   - Includes 25 unique personas (in `personas.py`) spanning various roles: AI ethicists, hardware engineers, legal experts, marketing strategists, etc.

2. **Multiple Persona Selection Methods**  
   - **Manual List Selection**: Pick from a displayed list of personas.  
   - **Semantic Search**: Type a short description of the persona type you need, and the system suggests best matches.  
   - **Auto Selection**: The application reads your idea and automatically picks the top personas based on similarity.

3. **Conversation Storage**  
   - All generated responses are embedded and stored in ChromaDB for context retrieval.  
   - Each new session starts fresh by clearing or resetting the conversation collection, ensuring no carryover from previous runs.

4. **Final Output**  
   - After the conversation, a final proposal is generated summarizing the idea, featuring an executive summary, recommended roadmap, and more.
